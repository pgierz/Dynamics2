In this excercise we will look at Foucault's Pendulum, which is a well known expirement
used to demonstrate the Earth's rotation. One such pendulum is
displayed at the entrance of the physics building at the university.

From the course script:

Let us denote $x$, $y$, $L$, and $\Theta$ as the coordinates of the
pendulum, the length of the string, and the angle of the pendulum bob,
respectively. The string tension due to gravity can be written as:

\begin{equation}
F_{g} = mg \left (\begin{array}{c} sin{\Theta} \\ sin{\Theta} \\
    cos{\Theta} \end{array} \right ) \approx mg \left (\begin{array}{c} x/L \\ y/L \\
    1-z/L \end{array} \right )
\end{equation} 

The horizontal dynamics can be explained via:

\begin{equation}
a_x = 2\Omega sin \varphi v_y - \frac{g}{L}x 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
a_y = 2\Omega sin \varphi v_x - \frac{g}{L}y
\end{equation}


\begin{enumerate}

\item Show the analytical solution by introducing the complex number
  $\xi = x + i \cdot y$

\item For Foucault's pendulum in Paris: the plane of the pendulum
  rotates clockwise $11^{\circ}$ per hour, making a full circle in
  32.7 hours. What is the period in Bremen?  What is the period at
  your home town?

\item Using the \texttt{shiny} program provided, compare the
  analytical solution with the numerical solution.

\item Geological evidence suggests that the Earth used to have a
  shorter day in the past, due to the impact forming the moon (angular
  momentum). What is
  the period of the pendulum on an Earth with only a 22 hour day for
  the 3 locations (Paris, Bremen, your home)?
\end{enumerate}

\underline{Notes on submission form of the exercises:}
 \textit{Students can work together, but each is required to submit
   his or her own solutions. The answers to the questions shall be send to paul.gierz@awi.de.}
