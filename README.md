Homework and Codes for Dynamics2 and Uni Bremen

To get the full directory structure with assignments, software, and
programs, go to a terminal and do

    git clone https://github.com/pgierz/Dynamics2.git 

To automatically download new homework and programs when they are
made, simply go to the Dynamics2 directory and do:

    cd $DYN2_DIR
    git pull

For me, `$DYN2_DIR` is `~/Doktor/Teaching/Dynamics2`. You may have it elsewhere.
