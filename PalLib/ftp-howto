Dear ftp-user,

the AWI runs an anonymous ftp-server that can be used to exchange data
with other institutions. The name of the server is

  ftp.awi.de       (or 134.1.2.17)

Anyone can access it via anonymous ftp, that is with

   username : ftp
   password : <her or his complete email-address>

If you are working with a ftp-tool that uses URLs for ftp-connections,
the URL of ftp.awi.de is

   ftp://ftp:<your email-address>@ftp.awi.de

Note: many default installations of web-browsers and ftp-tools have a
template password configured like IEuser@example.com for anonymous ftp-
connections. This is in most cases sufficient to log in on an anonymous
ftp-server. Nevertheless, it is a matter of netiquette to use your correct
email-address, so please take the time and update your browser configruration.

Once connected to our ftp-server, you may download files and directories 
from the trees under /incoming  and /pub . The maximum amount of data to
transfer is 50 Gb per session and a session is limited to 12 hours.


Anyone from inside the AWI-network may upload files to /incoming . This
is also done with username  "ftp"  and the complete email-address as
password. Again a data limit of 50 GB is imposed for uploads. Files
under /incoming will be deleted automatically after three days, but you
may not remove or overwrite existing files under /incoming yourself. So
if you got the feeling that something has gone wrong with your data, you
should contact ftpmaster@awi.de in order to get the problem fixed.

Please be careful in choosing filenames. Filenames may only be build from
the following set of characters

   A-Z a-z 0-9 - . _ @ #

and they must not begin with "-" or "." . You should also keep in mind, that
you are allowed to create directories under /incoming (same restrictions on
names as above) to store your files, but you are not allowed to create further
subdiretories.

******  ||| do not use blanks or tabs in filenames !!! *******


Uploads from outside the AWI-network are normally not allowed due to
legal reasons. But it is possible to configure an exception to that rule
for known outside partners and for a limited timespan (a few days). In
order to get this done we need to know the IP-address of the host, from
which the upload will be started. Once the address is configured, con-
nections from this address will be treated like inhouse connections,
thereby allowing uploads to /incoming with the restrictions on the amount
of data and on filenames from above.


Anyone who is going to upload files on our ftp-server should keep in
mind, that anyone else on the internet may access these files. So be
careful with what you are uploading and never put any confidentials on
the ftp-server.

In general, it is not possible to protect directories on the ftp-server
with a password, thereby limiting the access to those people who know 
this password (this would require those people to have an AWI-account).
A way to impose a password is to gather your data in zip-archives or
win-zip-archives and set a password for the entire archive (rar and
win-rar and the like are other methods to generate password-protected 
archives)


There are many other ways to use the ftp-server, but these require
special configurations tailored to the needs of AWI-workgroups. So if
you feel that the general procedure as outlined above does not fit
your requirements, please contact  ftpmaster@awi.de  .
